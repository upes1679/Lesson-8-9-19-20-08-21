public class Main {
    //Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that
    //are related to each other by inheritance.

    //Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class.
    //Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks.
    //This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
    //For example animal base class that has makeSound method and others classes implement it.

    //What is polymorphism in programming?
    //Polymorphism in programming is defined usage of a single symbol
    // to represent multiple different types.

    //We already discussed that method overloading is compile polymorphism and method overriding
    //is a runtime polymorphism

    //What is Polymorphism variables?
    //A polymorphic variable is defined as a variable that can hold
    // values of different types during the course of execution.

    //Why use Polymorphism in Java?
    //Polymorphism in Java makes it possible to write a method that
    //can correctly process lots of different types of functionalities
    //that have the same name. We can also gain consistency in our code by using polymorphism.

    //Advantages of Polymorphism in Java
    //It provides reusability to the code.
    //The classes that are written, tested and implemented can be reused multiple times.
    //This, in turn, saves a lot of time for the coder.
    //Also, the code can be changed without affecting the original code.
    //A single variable can be used to store multiple data values.
    //The value of a variable inherited from the superclass into the subclass can be
    //changed without changing that variableâ€™s value in the superclass or any other subclasses.
    //With lesser lines of code, it becomes easier for the programmer to debug the code.

    public static void main(String[] args){
        //Library is a building -inheritance
        //Library has books- composition
